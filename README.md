# ⚙️ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains my implementations and practice problems related to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
It serves as my personal learning archive and reference for interview preparation, problem-solving, and algorithmic thinking.

## 📘 Overview

The goal of this repository is to strengthen concepts of:
- Core **data structures** (arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs)
- Efficient **algorithm design**
- **Time and space complexity analysis**
- Solving **coding interview questions**
